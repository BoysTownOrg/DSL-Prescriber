Compared to the 042016 version, the 052017 version:
	- uses a .mat in place of an excel file to specify the hearing aid variables.An example .mat file (DSL Adult Fast) is located in this directory.
	- works for WDRC only. I did not test NFC.
	- minor updates to work with more current versions of MATLAB (for example, replaced wavread with audioread), but I didn't search for all instantances of wavread.
